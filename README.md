# EMPLOYEE_DJNAGO_REST_API
Create a Django model for Employee with name, email, phone, address, job title. Build serializers to convert to JSON, views to handle HTTP requests/responses, URLs to map views, and use authentication/authorization.  

LINE BY LINE HOW I MADE THIS :

Define the models: Create a Django model for the Employee object. This model should include fields such as name, email, phone number, address, job title, and any other relevant information.

Define the serializers: Django REST Framework uses serializers to convert model instances to JSON format. Create a serializer class for the Employee model that includes all the fields you want to expose in the API.

Define the views: Create view classes that handle HTTP requests and responses. These views should use the serializers to convert the data to and from JSON format.

Define the URLs: Map the views to specific URLs using Django's URL routing system.

Add authentication and authorization: Use Django's built-in authentication and authorization system to restrict access to the API to authenticated users only.

Test the API: Use tools like Postman or curl to test the API and ensure it is working as expected.
